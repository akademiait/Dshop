# Dshop


## The goal

Dshop is an educational project aimed at learning to work together using Github and Django. As a result, we will build an online store. To manage the project, we use tasks in [Clickup](https://clickup.com/), we use Kanban.

  During our work, we put special emphasis on:
  * using pull requests and working in a group
     * performing Code Review and learning how to create useful and friendly Code Reviews using good practices from [Google](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/comments.html)
  * code purity, verified automatically using Github Actions
  * introduction and, if possible, use of Test Driven Development based on pytest - tests will also be verified automatically
  * building a sense of individual responsibility for their work in a team
  * building a friendly and open work culture in the team
  * learning together and sharing knowledge through
    * conversations on Discord
    * live meetings (recorded for those absent)
    * remote training sessions, organized as needed

The ultimate goal is to equip community members with soft and hard skills to help them land their first IT job or move up in their current one.
